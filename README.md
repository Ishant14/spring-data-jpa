## Spring-data-jpa

Each of these defines its own functionality:

**CrudRepository** provides CRUD functions, 
**PagingAndSortingRepository** provides methods to do pagination and sort records, 
**JpaRepository** provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch

> And so, because of this inheritance relationship, the JpaRepository contains the full API of CrudRepository and 
PagingAndSortingRepository.

When we donâ€™t need the full functionality provided by JpaRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository, 
we can simply use the CrudRepository.
